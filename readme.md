# Database Approvals Automation
This is a powershell script that would speed up the process of sending database approvals to my management. It will check if today's file exists in our configured working directory. If it doesn't, then it will create the file and ask which list we are sending (first or second for the day). 

Then, it will draft and prompt a ready-to-send email to management.
